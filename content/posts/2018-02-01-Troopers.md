Hello Folks,

We are thrilled to announce the Blackhoodie event at Troopers 2018 on March 12th and 13th in Heidelberg. This time it is going to be a 2 day workshop with various interesting topics related to reverse engineering.
We will make sure that you get some hands on experience with reversing and more.

As always, one of the main motivation for Blackhoodie is bringing more women into reversing. So we would like to see more women apply to the training slots.
However, we are open to everyone who would like to apply. We do have a very limited number of seats at this training site. So we apologize in advance if we can't accommodate everyone, even though we wish we could!
Please apply before "February 20th" and we will contact you regarding next steps.
